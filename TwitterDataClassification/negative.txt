Closing in on the last couple of weeks of studying for the extreme exhaustion has set in
Somewhere stuck between "i hate school" and "i need a degree"
I HATE WHEN I BUMP INTO SOMEONE BY ACCIDENT & SAY SORRY WITH A SMILE BUT THEY GIVE ME THE NASTIEST LOOK LIKE BITCH DAMN IM ONLY HUMAN
when you forget to do homework and remember in bed then debate whether you should do it or fuck it and sleep
teacher: any questions?me: ya what the negtoken
teacher: do you understand now?me: yeah totallyteacher: walks away me: what the negtoken did she just say
I'm like 25% funny and 85% bad at maths
me everyday at any time to everyone ever: I'm so tired
So tired of looking in my wallet and not finding 100,000
