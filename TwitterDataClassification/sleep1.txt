 Me, all week: 
 Klase napud! Another sleepless nights and bloody war with the numbers and equations. ? 
 As an engineering major, do I even have time for fun? 
 Spent 7 hours in a windowless room in a dark building on a Sunday simulating the production of aromatics. 
 I passed on two parties this weekend to practice derivatives & work on loops. ? 
 may pasok pa bukas. Good night ?

 Summer classes are no joke
